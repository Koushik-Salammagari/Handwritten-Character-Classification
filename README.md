This project demonstrates the application of deep learning models for recognizing handwritten digits. It compares the performance of a simple Sequential model and a CNN, focusing on accuracy, training speed, and scalability. 
Various pre-processing techniques such as edge detection and pixel manipulation were applied to check for model performance (its impact on accuracy etc...)
